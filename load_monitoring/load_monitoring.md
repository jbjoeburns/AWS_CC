## CPU Load

***BAD MONITORING***

If CPU load is too high, this can lead to freezes or stop errors.

***BETTER MONITORING***

This can be monitored, so actions can be taken to remedy it, eg. spinning up more VMs for extra computing power or closing apps.
- However, this has **poor automation and needs constant monitoring**!

***GOOD MONITORING***

You can set up systems to send out an alarm/notification when CPU load is too high.

***BEST MONITORING/SOLUTION***

You can set up automated responses to high CPU load.

This is called **autoscaling** and will automatically launch more VMs when a CPU threshold is reached.
