## Cloud Computing

**What is it?:** Cloud computing is the ability to store and access data, applications, databases, as well as accessing computing power using rented remote servers as opposed to physical servers.

tl;dr Computing resources over the internet.

## History of Cloud Computing

DARPA initially funded MIT to develop ARPANET in 1969, the first iteration of what would become the internet. SalesForce in 1999 was the first to initially use cloud computing commercially to deliever software programs to end users who could purchase access to them. 

In 2002 Amazon introduced web-based retail services, then in 2006 they launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is the current leader in cloud computing services. Following this, various other cloud services were launched, such as Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud, with cloud computing being a common tool from than onwards.

## Cloud Computing Uses

The major advantage to cloud computing is that it allows you to use computing resources that would not be practical to physically own. 

This allows you to:
1. Store massive amounts of data
2. Data analysis with high processing power
3. Software testing
4. And many more things...

## 4 Types of Cloud

Private clouds: Cloud environments for use by a single end user, or group of end users.

Public clouds: Cloud environments not owned by the end user, eg AWS.

Hybrid clouds: Cloud environment created from multiple environments, uncluding LANs, WANs, VPNs and APIs typically consisting of more than one cloud, with it possibly being a combination of public and private.

Multiclouds: More than 1 cloud service from more than 1 cloud vendor, public or private.

## Different Types of Cloud Service

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Contains basics for cloud IT inluding networking features and storage. Allows you to build your system to suit your needs.

Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provides underlying infrastructure like updates, maintenance, patching and other aspects of running your application.

Software as a Service (SaaS): Provides completed functional cloud product ran by the service provider to give access to specific software available on the service.

## Advantages/Disadvantages of Cloud

Adv:
- Effective way of backing up data
- Can access data on any machine
- Easily scalable with upgrades that allow for expansion
- Secure

Disadv:
- Data held by third party, requires trust and reputation
- Difficult to migrate from providers
- Need internet to access data
- Subject to data breaches

## OpEx vs CapEx

Different types of business expenditures...

CapEx: Capital expenditures. These are purchases of significant services which are intended to improve future company gains. In relation to cloud computing, this could be purchasing services for future data storage or computing power, spending now to increase speed/capacity for later.

OpEx: Operating expenditures. The costs of running the business day to day. In the context of cloud computing this refers to the costs of renting current services.

## Marketshare

Market share is the percentage of total sales in a given industry generated by a specific company.

## Three Largest Cloud Providers

AWS: Largest market share, and provides primarily IaaS. Well known for high scalability and quick startup process.

Azure: 2nd largest market share. Used often for all three IaaS, PaaS and SaaS and has good interactivity with other Microsoft products.

GCP (Google Cloud Platform): 3rd largest market share. Specialised for AI, machine learning, data analysis and Kubernetes.

## 4 Pillars of DevOps and How They Relate to the Cloud

Sharing/Collaboration: Cloud computing can allow for multiple users to access the same storage/system for collaborative work on a project stored there.

Automation: Cloud services allow for automation in regards to tasks and upscaling.

Communication: Cloud computing has uses in communication through communication services that can be provided through the cloud like outlook.

Monitoring: Cloud services provide means to monitor your cloud hosted applications and their performance and any issues they're encountering.
